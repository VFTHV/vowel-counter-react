Vowel Counter App, React.

  You can run this project at:
https://vowel-counter-react.netlify.app/

This project was built while I was going through a React-Redux course.
I did not follow instructor's guidance and created it myself.
This project allowed me to practice React as well as JavaScript array methods for calculating the vowels.
